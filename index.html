      <h2>How It Works</h2>
      <p>For every area listed we went to the HM Land Registry to see:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>What the house price for first time buyers was in each of the 200 largest cities, towns, and districts.</li>
        <li>How much house prices had risen in the last 17 years (March 2008 - March 2025).</li>
      </ul>

      <p>We then projected this forward to account for what house prices would likely be in each area from 2026 - 2042.</p>

      <p>This means that for an 18 year old looking to buy at 35, we are looking at house prices in 2042. For a 25 year old looking to buy at 30, we are looking at house prices in 2030, etc.</p>

      <p>We then multiplied each of these numbers by 0.2 to come up with the typical 20% deposit that a first time buyer puts down on their property (this 20% figure comes from a 2024 report from the bank Halifax).</p>

      <p>We then divided this number by the number of months that passes between your age and the age you want to buy.</p>

      <p>For example, if someone started saving from 18-35, then the number was divided by 204 (17*12). Similarly, if someone started saving from 23-35, then the number was divided by 108 (9*12).</p>
